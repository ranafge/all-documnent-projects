You need to make the following changes

I believe you can do further processing from here onward.

What have you tried so far, can you please show us your effort ? â€“

Something like this should do it

What exactly is the math operation you're trying to do?

When I run this I get Mark Ramey Isn't that what you are looking for?

the request doesn't return the same thing every time.

You should just decode the content, like this:

Assuming this

You might be missing a few things in your code.

Which basically means the request has been successful.

it's not really clear from the description.

could you clarify?

The .content method comes from the requests library

 turn off capturing by putting "?:" in re module.

 Welcome to SO. Please take a minute to read How do I ask a good question? and provide A Minimal, Reproducible Example

CSRF tokens are generated by server to validate a client

Parse the json, and convert results_html to soup

next_page = response.xpath('//a[contains(., "- Next>>")]/@href').get()

You need to process each URL separatelly:

Don't forget to accept my answer :-)

You have a typo in your code here:

By using .get() you're telling Scrapy to return first match.


ou have to grap value from checked input

extract_first() returns a string or None that's why you can iterate it on next line.

for order of below value
FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS = ["name", "club", "league", "nation"]


It looks like your next_page is an array. Try to get it using .extract_first() instead of .extract() or .get() instead of .getall(). Also you need to use response.urljoin(next_page) to get target URL or even:

yield response.follow(next_page, callback=self.your_callback)


Sometimes .extract_first() returns None and you can't strip() it. I recommend you to use Scrapy Item Loaders

Please update your question with the code you have tried.

I found the API endpoint in Developer Tool -> Network -> XHR.

the table is dynamically rendered by JS


 I opened Developer Tool in Firefox/Chrome (shortcut F12), change tab to Network, set filter XHR (which means AJAX), and reload page - and then it 1s all files/urls/requests loaded by this page (filtered to AJAX requests) and then I click on links and see what these links sends to browser - if it is JSON data then I manually search information which I can see in your table on page - and I saw text from table Total Premiums Earned so I start checking if there is date which you are searching.

 You might want to try this:
Which type of error are you getting?

Eventually you can use string formatting with {} and .format(data_str)

dev tools

Some sites change their html code with javascript on load that requests won't access. You can check it with developer tools in chrome and disable javascript to see the result.
